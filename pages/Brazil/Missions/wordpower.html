        <h1>A music that Neymar may like</h1>
        <p>
          Neymar é um grande fã de diversos estilos musicais, como funk, pagode
          e sertanejo. Um outro estilo que ele gosta muito de ouvir é música
          eletrônica, então, embarquemos nessa onda, e a partir de uma música
          dessa estilo, tente reconhecer os dias da semana que faltam:

        </video>

        <p>
          Where there's a will, there's a way, kind of beautiful And every night
          has its day, so magical And if there's love in this life, there's no
          obstacle That can't be defeated
        </p>
        <p>
          For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable In every lost soul the
          bones of a miracle For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable With
          something to believe in
        </p>
        <p>
          _____ left me broken Tuesday I was through with hoping Wednesday my
          empty arms were open Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love Thank
          the stars it's ______ I'm burning like a fire gone wild on _____
          Guess I won't be coming to church on _____ I'll be waiting for love,
          waiting for love To come around
        </p>
        <p>
          We are one of a kind, irreplaceable How did I get so blind and so
          cynical? If there's love in this life we're unstoppable No we can't be
          defeated
        </p>
        <p>
          _____ left me broken Tuesday I was through with hoping Wednesday my
          empty arms were open Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love Thank
          the stars it's _____ I'm burning like a fire gone wild on _____
          Guess I won't be coming to church on _____ I'll be waiting for love,
          waiting for love To come around
